# League of Legends Viewership Analysis
Analysis on the effect teams, players, and roster stability has on viewership numbers for League of Legends professional play.

## Data 
Match-level viewership data is pulled from Esports Charts (https://escharts.com/). Currently only one split from LEC is provided for free through their dashboard demo. Data from multiple splits are needed to perform analysis on player and roster stability effects on viewership.

## Deploy
1. Install requirements.txt
2. Run anova_viewership.py

## Results
Teams in LEC for summer 2021 are significant for viewership. This should be unsuprising to any avid esports viewers. Fan loyalty often is directed towards teams, therefore viewership follows. The p-value 2021 summer LEC teams had on viewership was < 0.00001.

Due to costs, data from additional splits could not be acquired. This additional data is required to examine the effects of players and roster stability has on League of Legends professional play.
